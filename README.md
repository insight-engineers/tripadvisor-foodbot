## Overview

> [!NOTE]
> Data for this project is sourced from repositories in the [`include`](include/) directory. It is scraped and processed, cleaned using multiple modules. The `dm_tripadvisor` and `fs_tripadvisor` datasets are publicly available in BigQuery for authenticated users and power the restaurant recommendation system.

Restaurant recommendation system implementing **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** architecture with **vector search** and **multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA - ELECTRE III)**. Built on LlamaIndex for agent orchestration, Qdrant for vector storage, and BigQuery for data operations.

## Core Components
- **Vector Search**: Qdrant with FastEmbed for dense retrieval
- **MCDA Engine**: ELECTRE III implementation for ranking restaurants
- **LLM Integration**: OpenAI API with streaming response and generate final natural response
- **Data Layer**: BigQuery for structured data + Qdrant collections
- **Agent Framework**: LlamaIndex with custom tools and callbacks

## Technical Implementation

### Vector Search Pipeline

- FastEmbed for dense embeddings generation
- Qdrant collections for restaurant vectors
- Hybrid search combining semantic and metadata filtering

### MCDA Implementation

- **ELECTRE III** algorithm for restaurant ranking
- Custom concordance/discordance thresholds
- Multi-criteria evaluation:
  - Food quality (delicious, fresh, etc.)
  - Price sensitivity (affordable, expensive, etc.)
  - Ambience (quiet, cozy, etc.)
  - Service (friendly, fast, polite, etc.)
  - Distance to user location (using GPS)
  - Query matching (using `cosine similarity`)
  - Review sentiment (positive, negative, etc.)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Because **ELECTRE III** is a **decision analysis** algorithm calculated based on lots of matrix operations, it takes a lots of time to rank the restaurants with `numpy`. To improve the performance for better UX, we use `numba` to speed up the ranking process by compiling the `numpy`-based functions with `njit` (`@njit` - this is an alias for `@jit(nopython=True)`). This will make our `python` numpy-based functions run with near-C speed.

```

### Agent Implementation - `chat` directory

- LlamaIndex RAG implementation
- Custom tools for:
  - `candidate_generation_and_ranking`: generate candidate restaurants and rank them using MCDA
  - `enrich_restaurant_recommendations`: enrich the restaurant recommendations with more information, generate final natural response
- Streaming response handlers for tools callbacks
- Context management with chat history

## Development Setup

### Requirements

- `python ~= 3.11`
- `uv` package manager
- GCP account with BigQuery: [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
- OpenAI API key: [OpenAI Console](https://platform.openai.com/)
- Qdrant Cloud instance: [Qdrant Console](https://cloud.qdrant.io/)
- AWS S3 (or alternative storage service using S3 API)

### Quick Start

1. Install dependencies with `uv`

```bash
uv sync
```

2. Place GCP service account key and copy `.env.template` to `.env`

```bash
cp sa.json ./
cp .env.template .env
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `sa.json` is the credential file of the GCP service account. If not have, the BigQuery operations will not work.

3. Prepare `.env` file

  3.1 Generate a secret key for `chainlit` authentication (Optional, only required if you use `chainlit` UI)

  ```bash
  chainlit create-secret
  ```

  3.2 Prepare your GitHub OAuth credentials (Optional, only required if you use `chainlit` UI)

  > [Creating an OAuth app - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app)

3.3 Fill in the `.env` file with your credentials and configuration

  ```bash
  OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
  QDRANT_API_KEY=your-api-key
  QDRANT_API_URL=your-api-url
  AWS_REGION_NAME=your-region
  AWS_BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket-name
  AWS_BUCKET_ENDPOINT_URL=your-bucket-endpoint
  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key-id
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-access-key
  OAUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your-github-client-id
  OAUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your-github-client-secret
  CHAINLIT_AUTH_SECRET=generated-secret-key
  ```

4. Start development server

- For `chainlit` UI:
  ```bash
  make cl
  ```
- For `streamlit` UI:
  ```bash
  make st
  ```

### Dependencies

This project uses `uv` as the package manager. The dependencies are managed in the `uv` configuration file. You can find the dependencies in the `uv.yaml` file.

- Core: `llama-index`, `fastembed`, `qdrant-client`
- Data: `google-cloud-bigquery`, `pandas`
- UI: `streamlit`, `chainlit`
